IMPORTANT: The cpufeatures library has moved to $NDK/sources/android/cpufeatures
           and is now available as an import module (see docs/IMPORT-MODULE.TXT)

This header is only here to ensure that existing build scripts can still
reference $NDK/source/cpufeatures in their LOCAL_C_INCLUDES definition,
but it is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future NDK release.

Please modify your build scripts to import the library instead ASAP.

Thanks.
