This is a small library that extends the Android C library (Bionic),
by adding:

- better wchar_t support.

- long double functions (simple wrappers really, since 'long double' is
  equal to 'double' on Android).

- multibyte support (using UTF-8 as the only supported multibyte encoding).

- locale-specific variants of C library functions.

Many things are still incomplete.

The sources under the following directories come from the Musl C library:

  src/musl-ctype
  src/musl-multibyte

Most of them do not have a copyright disclaimer, this is intentional,
and how the sources appear in the Musl source tree. They are either in
the public domain, or covered by the following classic
MIT-style license:
