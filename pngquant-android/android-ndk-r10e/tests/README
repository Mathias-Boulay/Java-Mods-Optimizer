This directory contains scripts and sources to perform automated testing
of the NDK. Before making a new NDK release, please run tests/run-tests.sh
to ensure that everything is working properly.

Directory layout:

run-tests.sh
    Run all NDK automated tests. Use --help for more options.

build/
    Contains tests used to check the NDK build system itself.

device/
    Contains tests used to check that NDK-generated binaries work properly
    on an Android device. To run them, call "run-tests.sh" with the "adb" tool
    in your path (or with the --adb=<executable> option).
