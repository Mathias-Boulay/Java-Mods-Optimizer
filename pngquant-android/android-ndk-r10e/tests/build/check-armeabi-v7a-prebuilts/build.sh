# WARNING: VERY IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTE:
#
# The function below works by inspecting the architecture-specific
# attributes in an ELF file. Please be aware that the behaviour of
# binutils-2.19 and binutils-2.21 is different when generating these
# tags.
#
# 1/ When compiling for ARMv7-A targets, one can use any of the following
#    labels for the -mfpu=<name> option:
#
#        vfp
#        vfpv3
#        vfpv3-d16
#        neon
#
# 2/ There are two VFPv3 architectures defined by ARM:
#
#        VFPv3-D16  -> Mandates only 16 double FPU registers (d0-d15)
#        VFPv3-D32  -> Mandates 32 double FPU registers (d0-d31)
#
#    In addition, NEON requires VFPv3-D32
#
#    There is also VFPv2, which is an earlier version of VFPv3. Technically
#    speaking, VFPv3 is not completely backwards compatible with VFPv2 because
#    there are a few VFPv2 instructions it doesn't support.
#
# 3/ The table below indicates, for each -mfpu label, the following:
#
#     - The value of the 'Tag_VFP_arch' attribute that will be placed in
#       the generated object files or binaries (you can list them with
#       'readelf -A <file>')
#
#     - Whether the generated code uses 16 or 32 FPU double registers
#       (this is checked by looking at the disassembly of libgnustl_shared.so,
#       more specifically functions like 'cosf' or 'sinf' inside it).
#
#  First, for binutils-2.19:
#
#     fpu value           EABI tag          FPU reg count
#    -----------------------------------------------------
#       vfp                 VFPv2            16
#       vfpv3               VFPv3-D16        32 (*)
#       vfpv3-d16           VFPv3            16 (*)
#       neon                VFPv3            32
#
#  And now for binutils-2.21
#
#     fpu value           EABI tag          FPU reg count
#    -----------------------------------------------------
#       vfp                 VFPv2            16
#       vfpv3               VFPv3            32
#       vfpv3-d16           VFPv3-D16        16
#       neon                VFPv3            32
#
#  This shows that:
#
#    - The 'VFPv3' tag seems to match VFPv3-D32 exclusively on 2.21,
#      but is a mess with 2.19
#
#    - Similarly, the 'vfpv3' value seems to match VFPv3-D32 as well,
#      with the exception that binutils-2.19 is buggy and will put an
#      invalid tag (VFPv3-D16, instead of VFPv3) in the generate ELF file.
#
#    - binutils 2.19 puts the wrong tag in the executable for vfpv3 and
#      vfpv3-d16, then should probably be inverted!
#
#  The end result is that we can't use the EABI tag to determine the number
#  of hardware FPU registers that are really used by the machine code with
#  binutils 2.19 :-(
#
#  BONUS:
#
#    - When using 'neon', binutils-2.21 will also add a new tag named
#      'Tag_Advanced_SIMD_arch' with value 'NEONv1'. Sadly, binutils-2.19
#      doesn't do any of this.
#

# Check that an ELF binary is compatible with our armeabi-v7a ABI
# (i.e. no NEON, and only 16 hardware registers being used).
#
# See technical note above to understand how this currently works.
# We're still assuming the toolchain is built with the buggy binutils-2.19.
