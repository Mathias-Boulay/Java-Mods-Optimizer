# This is to compile all user code in -mhard-float (which implies

# by ndk-build), but still link system libm.so which use softfp.
# All functions in Android platform headers taking or returning float/double
# has __attribute__((pcs("aapcs"))), so even under the implied -mfloat-abi=hard
# softfp ABI is still observed by compiler for Android native APIs.
#
# You also need to ensure that
# 1. All code and library *must* be recompiled with consistent soft-abi.
#    If your project use ndk-build and import other project, you may want to do
#
#    $NDK/ndk-build -B APP_ABI=armeabi-v7a APP_CFLAGS=-mhard-float APP_LDFLAGS=-Wl,--no-warn-mismatch
#
#    If your project use libraries compiled by others, it's likely those were built with
#    -msoft-abi=softfp or evan -msoft-float (for armeabi).  Recompile them with -mhard-float
#
# 2. Correct headers (eg. #include <math.h>) are always included, and there is no
#    declaration like "extern double sin(double)" w/o proper __attribute__ in
#    your code instead of including math.h, etc.  See the end of sys/cdefs.h
#    the conditions upon which __NDK_FPABI__ and __NDK_FPABI_MATH__ are defined
#
# 3. All JNI functions should have JNICALL which is defined to __NDK_FPABI__ in jni.h.
#
# 4. If you use undocumented APIs which takes/returns float/double, be careful
#    to add __attribute__((pcs("aapcs"))) for arm
#
# Note that "--no-warn-mismatch" is needed for linker (except mclinker which check correctly)
# to suppress linker error about not all functions use VFP register to pass argument, eg.
#
#   .../arm-linux-androideabi/bin/ld: error: ..../test-float.o
#           uses VFP register arguments, output does not
