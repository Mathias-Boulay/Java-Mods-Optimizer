This test is meant to test the GABI++ library which provides C++
RTTI and exceptions support without using the GNU libsupc++.a

This is really a way to check that the C++ compiler properly links against
libgabi++_static and libgabi++_shared without any kind of conflict, and that
dynamic_cast<> and try..throw..catch really work.
